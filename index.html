				<h2>Introductionüëã</h2>
				<p>
					My name is Mark Johansen. I am 20 years old. I currently
					study Computer Science at SDU in Denmark. I have always had
					a knack for writing code. My two strongest principles when
					writing code are simplicity and efficiency. Through many
					projects and problems, I have found my ground in the quote:
					<i
						>A fool admires complexity, a genius admires
						simplicity.</i
					>
					And my code shall bloom by that.

				<p>
					Here are some of the unscrapped projects I have throughout

						<a

							>Wallhaven Downloader</a
						>
						(2022)
					</li>
					<p>
						A simple Python script utilizing threads and requests to
						download wallpapers and change your background on each
						boot.
					</p>
					<li>
						Comparator Networks (2024) (link currently hidden due to
						possible plagarizing)
					</li>
					<p>
						A larger project (given by the college) focusing on the
						minimizing of sorting components in hardware. Utilized
						areas from machine learning to optimize it further.
					</p>
					<li>Two websites</li>
					<p>
						These websites are lost due to PC's resetting and
						forgetting to backup before losing OneDrives. Both
						websites included databases (one with standard PHP and
						SQL) and the other had utilized Django and SQLite.
